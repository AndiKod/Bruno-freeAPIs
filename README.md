# Free APIs requests Collection via Bruno

A collection—in the making—of free API calls to some useful tools when prototyping or even creating production ready websites & webapps.

Bruno will generate the actual code for each request, in close to 40 languages or variations. Ready to copy/paste or customise further, and a lot more.

Each API is an actual folder, and each request a [.bru file](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-lang/overview) that contains everything, including eventual doccumentation, in a legible way.

## Install & Use

1. Install [Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/download).

2. Clone that Repo.

3. Open the cloned folder with Bruno.

4. If needed, place secret variables in your local .env

_Requests can also be tested from the terminal with the [Bruno CLI](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-cli/overview)_
